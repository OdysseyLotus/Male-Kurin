	<description>Adds male Kurin.
	
Probably the most requested alien race, here are the Male Kurin. I have added male bodies, faces, hair (from Ponytails are Kawaii (Continued) and Roppoi hair), apparel, and names. You can now play with your dream femboy Kurin to your heart's content.

If there are any other alien races you want me to add males to, let me know and I might devote some time to creating those assets and patches as well.

Additionally, to the original mod authors, if you have any issues or comments, please let me know. I have the utmost respect for you and your efforts and I don't want to offend.</description>
